# Ball Simulation ðŸŽ®

## __Introduction__
This project is a simple 2D physics-based ball simulation built with Pygame and Pymunk. Users can create dynamic, gravity-driven balls that interact with each other and bounce off walls. The ball radius, color, and elasticity vary based on the mouse position and wheel input, creating a visually interactive experience.

## __Features__
  + __Dynamic Ball Creation__: Click to create balls with customizable radius, elasticity, and color based on mouse position.
  + __Mouse-Controlled Radius__: Use the mouse wheel to adjust the radius of the balls.
  + __Realistic Physics__: Balls respond to gravity and bounce off walls with variable elasticity.
  + __Collision Handling__: Balls collide with each other and react based on real-time physics calculations.
  + __Interactive Visualization__: Pymunkâ€™s physics engine is combined with Pygameâ€™s rendering to simulate real-time physics in an engaging visual display.

## __Usage__
  + __Left Click__: Add a new ball at the mouse position.
  + __Mouse Wheel__: Increase or decrease the size of the next ball to be spawned.
  + Balls automatically fall and bounce off the bottom wall, affected by gravity.

## __Requirements__

  + Python 3.x
  + Pygame
  + Pymunk
